                <p>Therefore, please noter that the choosing the  safari zone, safari driver or naturalist guide is not in out hands. All these are solely decided by the forest offcials on the random basis managed by the automated computerized system to make sure the distribution of  safari vehicles is equal in every zone. According to the current  Tiger Safari Booking policy, the 20 jeeps of 6 seaters and 20 Canter of 20 seaters are allowed to enter in the  National Park in one shift. At the  National park, the safari tour is allowed in two shifts; morning shift and afternoon shift. You have the choice to choose your safari shift time. The  National Park online booking is done on the first come, first served basis and you must have to pay the full fee in advance for the  Tiger safari booking. The vehicle is allotted on the day of the  Forest safari and the fee for a confirm seat in a Jeep or Canter is non-refundable and non-transferable.</p>
